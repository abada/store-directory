A simple, flexible plugin for keeping a store/location directory and searching for them by radius.

This plugin is intentionally light and simple. It's very flexible and is intended to be something on which you can build.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add stores via the "Stores" menu in the left.
